## How to make it work

This folder contains only the shiny part of the app. App itself depends on multiple cached files since otherwise computations are too intensive for app to be responsive.

These files can be prepared with `eda.R`. Once they are saved into `shiny` folder, `app.R` is the file that runs the app itself.

`stopwords-iso.json` are stopwords words for multiple languages I've found somewhere on GitHub lying around.
