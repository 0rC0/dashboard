# tracking.exposed dashboard

## What is this?

This repository contains python and R code that might be useful for data scientists to download, modify and analyze Facebook (and in the near future Youtube or other platforms supported by tracking.exposed) data. It includes a R shiny app to visualize data and python notebooks.
The tools aim at understanding more about algorithms and their impact on peoples lives and on society, note that you can only use your own token(s) with the dashboard, so you should install the facebook.tracking.exposed first.

## Who is this for?

#### Data scientist
Data scientists with some knowledge of python or R can use this repository as a starting point to develop more complex visualizations with their own tracking.exposed datasets. Many features can be implemented easily in the library, just add some code and make a PR or open an issue.

#### Researchers
This tools are free to use and modify and can be employed to conduct research in an academic context. Social scientists as well as researchers with a different background can use the tools to answer questions about the inner mechanics of the algorithm.
